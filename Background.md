# Some Technical Background About the Technologies

1. Technology & Operating Range
RFID:
Uses radio waves to communicate between a reader and a tag.
Operates over a range of frequencies: low-frequency (LF, ~125-134 kHz), high-frequency (HF, 13.56 MHz), and ultra-high-frequency (UHF, ~860-960 MHz).
The range can vary significantly depending on the frequency:
LF: ~10 cm
HF: ~1 m
UHF: up to ~12 m or more.
NFC:
Operates at a specific frequency: 13.56 MHz (a subset of HF RFID).
Extremely short range: typically up to 10 cm, but often works at 4-5 cm for security reasons.
2. Communication Direction
RFID:
Generally one-way communication: the reader sends a signal, and the tag responds with its stored data.
Active RFID tags can transmit data independently but are rare.
NFC:
Supports two-way communication: both devices (e.g., smartphone and payment terminal) can send and receive data, enabling more interactive use cases.
3. Power Source
RFID:
Tags can be:
Passive: Powered by the electromagnetic field generated by the reader.
Active: Powered by an internal battery for longer ranges and more functionality.
NFC:
Always passive-powered from the reader or device it communicates with (like a smartphone or terminal).
4. Applications
RFID:
Used for identification and tracking in logistics, supply chains, inventory management, and security systems.
Examples: Toll collection systems, library book tracking, livestock tagging.
NFC:
Designed for short-range applications that require secure data exchange.
Examples: Contactless payments (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay), smartphone pairing, public transportation cards, and access control.
5. Security
RFID:
Less secure, especially passive RFID, as it is primarily designed for identification, not data protection.
Can be eavesdropped or cloned without strong encryption.
NFC:
More secure, with built-in encryption and secure protocols like those used in payment systems.
Limited range further reduces security risks.
6. Device Support
RFID:
Requires specialized readers.
Tags are simple and low-cost.
NFC:
Integrated into most modern smartphones, which act as both readers and writers.
Summary
Feature	RFID	NFC
Frequency	LF, HF, UHF	13.56 MHz (HF)
Range	Up to ~12 m (UHF)	Up to ~10 cm

In essence, RFID is suited for long-range identification and tracking, while NFC is tailored for secure, close-proximity interactions.


The RFID and NFC capabilities of the Flipper Zero are implemented using specific hardware, including:
1. Dedicated RFID and NFC Chip
Chip Used: The Flipper Zero uses an STMicroelectronics ST25R3916 chip to handle RFID and NFC communication.
ST25R3916 Highlights:
Supports 13.56 MHz communication for both RFID (HF) and NFC.
Capable of ISO 14443 (used by MIFARE cards), ISO 15693, and FeliCa standards.
Allows for both reader mode and card emulation mode.
Features high-performance antenna driving for improved communication with tags.
Built-in features for energy harvesting to power passive tags.
2. Low-Frequency (125 kHz) RFID
Custom LF RFID System:
The Flipper Zero has a separate circuit for 125 kHz RFID communication, which is commonly used for access cards and tags like EM4100 and HID Prox.
The LF system involves:
A dedicated analog front-end for signal detection and generation.
Custom coil antenna to transmit and receive LF signals.
3. Antennas
HF Antenna (13.56 MHz):
The NFC/RFID HF antenna is tightly integrated with the ST25R3916 chip to transmit and receive signals at 13.56 MHz.
The antenna is optimized for short-range communication, allowing reliable interaction with tags and devices.
LF Antenna (125 kHz):
A custom-designed low-frequency coil antenna, tuned specifically for 125 kHz RFID communication.
This antenna allows the Flipper Zero to interact with older RFID tags.
4. Microcontroller
MCU: STM32 microcontroller (STM32WB55)
Handles signal processing, communication protocols, and overall control of the RFID/NFC chip.
Runs the firmware that implements reading, writing, and emulation functionalities.
How It Works: The Process
Reading RFID or NFC Tags:
The antenna generates an electromagnetic field (via the ST25R3916 chip for HF or custom circuitry for LF).
Passive RFID/NFC tags in range harvest power from this field to activate their internal circuits.
The tag sends back its stored information (e.g., UID or data) using a modulated signal.
The Flipper’s hardware demodulates and decodes the signal, and the STM32 processes the data.
Writing to Tags:
The Flipper Zero uses its antenna to send modulated signals back to a writable RFID/NFC tag.
The tag’s memory is updated with the new data sent by the Flipper.
The process is handled by the ST25R3916 for HF and custom LF circuitry for 125 kHz tags.
Emulating Tags:
The Flipper generates a signal mimicking the stored data of a tag.
For HF emulation, the ST25R3916 chip actively generates the modulation patterns required to emulate a card.
For LF emulation, the custom LF circuitry generates the 125 kHz carrier signal modulated with the appropriate tag data.
Why the Flipper Zero is Limited to Certain Standards
Chip Capabilities:
The ST25R3916 chip supports widely used RFID/NFC standards like ISO 14443 and ISO 15693, but it cannot inherently process proprietary or encrypted protocols (e.g., MIFARE DESFire) without additional keys or software.
Antenna Design:
The short-range, compact antennas are optimized for common frequencies but limit long-range or less-used frequency support.
Firmware Limitations:
While the hardware can handle certain advanced features, the firmware focuses on widely used protocols to balance functionality and usability.
Signal Generation and Detection
The RFID/NFC chips and custom circuitry generate high-frequency alternating currents in the antennas, creating the electromagnetic fields needed for communication.
For detection, these systems measure changes in the electromagnetic field caused by tags or devices within range, enabling the Flipper to decode their data.
In Summary
The ST25R3916 NFC/RFID chip drives most of the 13.56 MHz functionality, including reading, writing, and emulation.
A custom-designed LF analog front-end and coil antenna handle 125 kHz RFID communication.
A powerful STM32 microcontroller coordinates signal processing, firmware execution, and interaction between the user and the hardware.
The Flipper Zero’s limitations are primarily due to its hardware design (optimized for common standards) and firmware scope (focused on usability).
This combination of hardware and software makes the Flipper Zero a highly capable yet compact tool for RFID and NFC operations!
